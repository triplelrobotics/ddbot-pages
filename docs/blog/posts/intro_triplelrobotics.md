# Introduce TripleL Robotics

Welcome to TripleL Robotics, a robotic start-up working on building lower-cost robots with extensive AI capability for undergrad and grad robotic education and research. We will share our progress through weekly posts and any of your feedback is appreciated. :)

Our mission is to enhance the robots with cutting-edge AI techniques such as deep learning and reinforcement learning to handle various tasks, including vision/lidar-based navigation, collision avoidance, hand gesture control, adaptive control in complex environments, etc. To achieve this, we will equip robots with powerful computing units as well as rich sensors such as IMUs, RGB-D cameras, Lidars, and ultrasonic modules. We will also open source easy-to-use software and comprehensive tutorials to reduce the learning curve. Our ultimate goal is to make these robots as central hardware for a series of AI robotic projects for educational purposes, at affordable prices.
